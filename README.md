# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains various **data structures** and **algorithm implementations** written in C++. It is designed to serve as a resource for learning and practicing essential data structures and solving algorithmic problems commonly asked in technical interviews. The code is organized by topics such as **arrays**, **linked lists**, **stacks**, **queues**, and solutions to problems from **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide clear, concise, and efficient implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, using C++. It also includes solutions to popular coding challenges that help reinforce understanding of these topics.

Whether you're learning data structures for the first time or preparing for coding interviews, this repository can serve as a helpful guide.

## Project Structure

### 1. List of Data Structures
The following data structures are implemented with corresponding operations:

- **Arrays**:
  - Non-circular and circular implementations.
  - Basic operations like insertion, deletion, retrieval, and traversal.
- **Linked Lists**:
  - Singly linked list implementation.
  - Reversing a linked list using both pointers and stack methods.
- **Stacks**:
  - Stack implemented using arrays and queues.
  - Operations: push, pop, and peek.
- **Queues**:
  - Queue implemented using arrays and stacks.
  - Circular queue implementation with enqueue and dequeue operations.

### 2. LeetCode Problems
This section contains solutions to popular **LeetCode problems**. The solutions are implemented using fundamental data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists. Some examples include:

- **Array Implementations**:
  - Circular and non-circular array operations.
- **Stack and Queue Implementations**:
  - Implement Stack using Queues.
  - Implement Queue using Stacks.
- **Linked List Implementations**:
  - Reversing linked lists using both stack and pointer approaches.
  - Designing maps and sets using linked lists.

### 3. GFG Problems
This section contains implementations of algorithms and problems from **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**, focusing on graph traversal and search algorithms:

- **Graph Traversal**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** implementation.
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)** implementation.

Each file corresponds to a specific problem and is well-commented to explain the approach and solution.
